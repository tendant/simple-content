## 📊 Developer Experience Improvements

### Before (Previous State)

- ❌ No working examples - learn by trial and error
- ❌ No extensibility - had to fork to customize
- ❌ No middleware system - manual HTTP handling
- ❌ Complex configuration - many options to understand

### After (Current State)
- ✅ 5-minute quickstart with working code
- ✅ Complete example applications to learn from
- ✅ Hook system for service-level extensibility
- ✅ Middleware system for HTTP-level extensibility
- ✅ Good defaults (in-memory works immediately)
- ✅ Clear progression (dev → test → production)
